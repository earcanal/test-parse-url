# test-parse-url

This is an Experiment that is intended for testing parsing of a url in a container. It is intended for use in an [Experiment Factory](https://expfactory.github.io/expfactory) container. You can run it locally by putting these files in a web server, or use the Experiment Factory to generate a reproducible container. Check out the documentation above for more information, or [post an issue](https://www.github.com/expfactory/expfactory/issues) if you have any questions.
